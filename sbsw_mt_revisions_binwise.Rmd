This script contains revised data analysis and figures for the SBSW manuscript while retaining the bin-wise nature of the differential expression analysis (ie each DESeq2 analysis was generated by the genes specific to a given bin, then all stitched together into one results table)

Pros: 
1. Specificity of understanding up/down-regulated genes in a given genome, genome-wise trends

Cons:
1. Are p-values and LFC values comparable if they are not generated all together?
